# Downloads-Organizer
Python program to organize your downloads folder automatically.

## How It Works
Files in the directory you specify will be moved to respective folders with that extension (automatic organization). If you have an existing directory with the name png (even if it does not just contain .png files), the .png files in the root directory of your specified folder will be saved there -- so be careful with how you use this!

## How To Use
Simply install Python3, install requirements using your favorite virtual environment, and add a bash script to run main.py at startup.

## Supported Systems
This script is tested and run on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS and up, but I have not tested on any other systems.
